**Motivation**

We have always enjoyed playing games since we were young and wanted to try making games. From MOBA games to open world RPGs, we have enjoyed a variety of different genres of games. We want to create a game that gives people a rush of excitement and adrenaline, as well as the urge to continue playing, just like the experiences we had playing our favourite games.


**Aim**

We want to create a 2D Platformer Game that is engaging and accessible. This means focusing on clear mechanics that are easy to grasp but offer depth and challenge as players progress. On the technical side, smooth gameplay is a priority. We'll strive for clean, efficient code that minimises bugs and ensures a frustration-free experience. This might involve using beginner-friendly tools or frameworks initially, while keeping an eye on learning more advanced coding techniques as we develop our skills.

# Project Scope:

## Game Overview

*<span style="text - decoration: underline;">One sentence version*</span>*:*

"Arctic Meltdown" is a 2D platformer where players guide Pippin, a prehistoric penguin, through a melting Arctic, uncovering ancient mysteries and overcoming obstacles in a visually captivating adventure.

*<span style="text - decoration: underline;">Longer descriptive version*</span>*:*

"Arctic Meltdown" is a 2D platformer game that follows the journey of Pippin, a prehistoric penguin, as he navigates through an ever-changing and melting Arctic environment. Players will guide Pippin from the depths of the Earth’s core, overcoming various obstacles and uncovering the mysteries of his ancient world. It promises an engaging and visually captivating journey that blends adventure and platforming elements. By guiding Pippin through his icy adventure, players will experience a rich storyline and challenging gameplay, making "Arctic Meltdown" a memorable addition to the 2D platformer genre.

## Storyline



Deep beneath the ice, where the ancient whispers of the Earth are frozen in time, lived a prehistoric penguin named Pippin. Pippin, whose existence was a testament to a forgotten era, had been in a state of suspended animation for millennia. His coat was as dark as the midnight sea, and his eyes sparkled with the wisdom of ages past. However, the relentless grip of global warming had finally reached his icy sanctuary, and the thawing ice gently nudged him back to consciousness.

Awakening from his long slumber, Pippin found himself in a world vastly different from the one he knew. His heart, stout and courageous, beat with a renewed purpose:

**The journey back to the Arctic surface.**

Are you ready to step into the ice and relive the past? Guide Pippin through his perilous journey, unravel the mysteries of the ancient world, and overcome the odds in this unforgettable adventure.

# UI Menus

# 

## Main Menu

![Enter image alt description](Images/0QO_Image_11.png)
Upon Entering the game, the user will be brought to the main menu screen where he will be given the option to read the jump right into the game, read the story of Pippin, see the instructions on the controls of the game, and to exit the game.

The STORY button will bring the user to a scene with multiple pages. The user can use the “PREVIOUS” and “NEXT” buttons at the bottom of the screen to navigate between the pages and read up on the story of Pippin.

The CONTROLS button will bring the user to a page that will show the controls of the game, allowing new players to familiarise themselves with the keys to press in order to play the game. The Main Menu button at the bottom right of the page allows for the user to return to the main menu to begin their adventure.


## Pause Menu

Upon pressing the *escape key* while the game is active, time within the game will come to a stop and the pause menu will be activated. The image above shows what players will be shown upon pausing the game. By using the *arrow keys* to navigate the snowflake across the options, players can adjust the volume of the in-game sounds and music just by clicking on the respective buttons. They can choose to return back to the main menu or even quit the game from there. Upon resuming, time within the game will return back to normal. 

## Death Menu

When the player’s health falls below 1, the player will die and a loud bell will ring. This will activate the Death Menu. From here, the player will be able to decide whether to return to the main menu, restart the level, or exit the game. Restarting the level will restart the game from the latest level reached by the player, with full health, and the player’s original coin count.

# Camera Effects

On top of the respective camera scripts written for the various camera effects such as camera shaking, or following the Player from room to room, we have added a “Pixel Perfect Camera” component to all our camera game objects to change the look of our non pixelated sprites into a pixel art, enhancing our choice of a pixel art design for our game.


# Enemies

## Patrolling Enemy

- Moves back and forth within the platform area

- Attacks upon contact with Player

- Melee attacks

## Flying Enemy

- Has a small detection range

- Will chase Player upon detection

- Returns back to its original position once Player escapes the detection range or leaves the current room

- Melee attacks

## Ranged Enemy:

- Has a small detection range

- Will be alerted once Player enters detection range

- Will attack Player upon detection

- Stop attacking once player leaves the detection range or leaves the current room

- Ranged and Melee attacks

# Collectables

## Health Pickup:

The health pickup is represented using a heart shape, which is the same as the health icons on the top left of the screen, signifying the player’s health. Colliding into the health pickup will replenish 1 of the hearts lost if the player's health is not full.

## Coin Pickup:

The coin pickup is represented using a coin icon. A tracker of how many coins the player has collected while playing the game is positioned at the top left of the screen UI, right below the health. Collecting a coin will increase the tracker count. At the end of each level, the player will be able to access a shop where he can use the collected coins to purchase power ups to upgrade their skills as the game progresses to further later levels.


# Power Ups

Each power up costs 3 coins to purchase.

They are currently only purchasable at the end of each level.

| Name | Description | Icon |
|---|---|---|
| Increased Maximum Health | Maximum number of hearts the Player can possess will be increased by one.
(i.e. more health) |  |
| Increased Movement Speed | Player’s horizontal movement speed is doubled.
(i.e. run faster) |  |
| Increased Jump Count | Maximum number of consecutive jumps before landing on the ground or wall is increased by one.
(i.e. more jumps) |  |
| Increased Jump Force | Height of each jump is increased by 2 units.
(i.e higher jumps) |  |
| Reduce Attack Cooldown | The duration of the interval between consecutive attacks from the player is reduced.
(i.e. faster attack speed)
 |  |


# User Testing

On 18th June, We conducted a few tests by playing the game ourselves and letting our friends play it too. We have then recorded down the feedback gathered and implemented the respective changes for an improved experience.

Criticism:

- Jumping feels like “floating”

- Sometimes player gets stuck to the walls

- Controls might not be obvious for new players

- Too difficult to find coins

- Pause menu still accessible when death screen is active

- Flying enemies chases Player into next room

- Ranged enemies from other rooms also attacks the Player if within range

- Unable to tell at which range the ranged enemies detect the Player

- Death menu does not activate when Player dies mid-air

- Going from pause screen to main menu, and then to a new game will result in the game freezing

Compliments:

- Game startup is pleasing to watch

- Randomness of map layouts interesting to explore

- Death screen very nice

- Pleasing background music

- Game controls are easy to learn and pick up.

Improvements:

- Added increased gravity when falling downwards

- Added material with no friction to box colliders to prevent sticking

- Added a controls page that players can access from the main menu

- Increased the spawn rate of coins within the maps

- Fixed issue to make pause screen inactive if death screen is active

- Flying and ranged enemies now check if Player is in the same room before attacking

- Added “alerted” animation for ranged enemies, giving the Player a visual cue upon detection

- Activation of the death menu changed to player health rather than death animation

- Reset the time back to normal speed when exiting the pause menu no matter what


# System Testing

| 24 | Move horizontally while crouching | Slide animation is active and Player’s speed is increased slightly. Particle effects are also present. |


# Automated Testing

We have integrated Unity's automated testing unit into our development process to enhance our testing procedures. We've incorporated various test cases within our Test script and utilised the Test Runner to execute them, ensuring the reliability and functionality of our game features.

![Enter image alt description](Images/snb_Image_12.png)

This approach streamlines our testing efforts significantly. Instead of manually testing the game after every code update or component addition, we rely on automated tests to verify both existing and newly implemented features, ensuring seamless integration and maintaining overall product quality.

**Current Progress:**

- Maps generation works

- Player movement and interaction is smooth

- Patrolling melee enemy functional

- Flying enemies functional

- Ranged enemies functional

- Traps and hazards functional

- End of game scene

- Integrated audio into the game

- Health system works

- Game camera movement follows player stage

- Starting behaviour of the camera allows for a quick visual introduction of the game.

- Player attack works

- The multiple UI screens work.

**To-do:**

- Implement a proper shopping system so as to allow players to choose what to buy, rather than being forced to buy what powerup is randomly spawned

- Improve UI for smoother user experience

- Update the art for the “Story” component of the game

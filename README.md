**NUS Orbital 2024 - Milestone 1**

**Proposed Level of Achievement:** 

Apollo 11

**Motivation** 

We have always enjoyed playing games since we were young and wanted to try making games. From MOBA games to open world RPGs, we have enjoyed a variety of different genres of games. We want to create a game that gives people a rush of excitement and adrenaline, as well as the urge to continue playing, just like the experiences we had playing our favorite games.

**Aim**

We want to create a 2D Platformer Game that is engaging and accessible. This means focusing on clear mechanics that are easy to grasp but offer depth and challenge as players progress. On the technical side, smooth gameplay is a priority. We'll strive for clean, efficient code that minimizes bugs and ensures a frustration-free experience. This might involve using beginner-friendly tools or frameworks initially, while keeping an eye on learning more advanced coding techniques as we develop our skills.

**Storyline**



Deep beneath the ice, where the ancient whispers of the Earth are frozen in time, lived a prehistoric penguin named Pippin. Pippin, whose existence was a testament to a forgotten era, had been in a state of suspended animation for millennia. His coat was as dark as the midnight sea, and his eyes sparkled with the wisdom of ages past. However, the relentless grip of global warming had finally reached his icy sanctuary, and the thawing ice gently nudged him back to consciousness.

Awakening from his long slumber, Pippin found himself in a world vastly different from the one he knew. His heart, stout and courageous, beat with a renewed purpose:

**The journey back to the Arctic surface.**

Follow Pippin, the prehistoric penguin, on his journey back to the arctic surface, overcoming the odds of survival against him.
